# RebaseErc20 Vault Technical Documentation

[📄 View Source Code](../../contracts/vaults/RebaseErc20.vy)

## Overview

RebaseErc20 is a yield-optimized vault designed for rebase tokens and yield-generating assets like stETH, rETH, and aTokens. It automatically captures rebases and compounds yield through share-based accounting, providing depositors with passive growth without active management.

**Core Functions**:
- **Share-Based Accounting**: Converts deposits to shares representing proportional vault ownership
- **Automatic Compounding**: Captures rebases and yield without user intervention
- **Fair Distribution**: Maintains accurate ownership percentages as vault value grows

Built on the SharesVault module, RebaseErc20 implements sophisticated yield capture mechanics. Share values appreciate as underlying assets rebase or generate rewards, donation attack protection ensures vault security, and seamless protocol integration enables use as collateral while earning yield.

## Architecture & Dependencies

RebaseErc20 is built using a modular architecture with delegation to yield-focused modules:

### Core Module Dependencies
- **SharesVault**: Provides yield-bearing vault functionality with share-based accounting
- **VaultData**: Manages user share balances, asset registration, and vault state
- **[Addys](../shared-modules/Addys.md)**: Handles protocol address resolution and permission management

### Module Initialization
```vyper
exports: addys.__interface__
exports: vaultData.__interface__
exports: sharesVault.__interface__

initializes: addys
initializes: vaultData[addys := addys]
initializes: sharesVault[vaultData := vaultData]
```

## Constructor

### `__init__`

Initializes RebaseErc20 vault with protocol address configuration.

```vyper
@deploy
def __init__(_ripeHq: address):
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `_ripeHq` | `address` | RipeHq contract address for protocol integration |

#### Process Flow
1. **Address Setup**: Initializes Addys module with RipeHq address
2. **VaultData Setup**: Initializes with non-paused state (`False`)
3. **SharesVault Setup**: Initializes share-based vault functionality

#### Example Usage
```python
# Deploy rebase ERC20 vault
rebase_erc20_vault = boa.load(
    "contracts/vaults/RebaseErc20.vy",
    ripe_hq.address
)
```

## Core Functions

### `depositTokensInVault`

Handles deposits of rebase tokens with share-based accounting for yield capture.

```vyper
@nonreentrant
@external
def depositTokensInVault(
    _user: address,
    _asset: address,
    _amount: uint256,
    _a: addys.Addys = empty(addys.Addys),
) -> uint256:
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `_user` | `address` | User making the deposit |
| `_asset` | `address` | Rebase/yield-generating token to deposit |
| `_amount` | `uint256` | Amount of tokens to deposit |
| `_a` | `addys.Addys` | Protocol addresses struct (unused) |

#### Returns

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `uint256` | Actual amount deposited |

#### Access

Only callable by Teller

#### Process Flow
1. **Access Validation**: Ensures caller is Teller contract
2. **SharesVault Delegation**: Calls `sharesVault._depositTokensInVault()` for core functionality
3. **Share Calculation**: Converts deposited amount to shares based on current share price:
   ```
   shares = (depositAmount * totalShares) / totalAssetBalance
   ```
4. **Balance Storage**: Stores shares (not amounts) in VaultData user balances
5. **Event Emission**: Logs deposit with user, asset, amount, and shares minted
6. **Return**: Returns actual deposit amount

#### Events Emitted

- `RebaseErc20VaultDeposit` - Contains user, asset, amount deposited, and shares minted

#### Share Price Dynamics
- **First Deposit**: Creates initial 1:1 share-to-asset ratio
- **Subsequent Deposits**: Share price reflects accumulated yield/rebases
- **Yield Accumulation**: As vault's asset balance grows from rebases, share price increases
- **Fair Entry**: New depositors pay current share price, ensuring fair distribution

#### Example Usage
```python
# Deposit stETH (a rebase token) into vault through Teller
deposit_amount = rebase_erc20_vault.depositTokensInVault(
    user.address,
    steth_token.address,
    1_000000000000000000,  # 1 stETH
    empty(addys.Addys),
    sender=teller.address
)

# User receives shares representing proportional vault ownership
# Share amount depends on current share price (influenced by accumulated yield)
```

### `withdrawTokensFromVault`

Handles withdrawals from yield-bearing vault with share burning and asset conversion.

```vyper
@nonreentrant
@external
def withdrawTokensFromVault(
    _user: address,

| `bool` | True if user's position is now depleted |

#### Access

Only callable by Teller, AuctionHouse, or CreditEngine

#### Process Flow
1. **Access Validation**: Ensures caller is authorized contract
2. **SharesVault Delegation**: Calls `sharesVault._withdrawTokensFromVault()` for core functionality
3. **Share Calculation**: Determines shares needed for requested amount:
   ```
   sharesToBurn = (requestedAmount * totalShares) / totalAssetBalance
   ```
4. **Share Burning**: Reduces user's share balance in VaultData
5. **Asset Transfer**: Transfers calculated amount (may be more than originally deposited due to yield)
6. **Event Emission**: Logs withdrawal with shares burned and depletion status
7. **Return**: Returns actual withdrawal amount and depletion status

#### Events Emitted

- `RebaseErc20VaultWithdrawal` - Contains user, asset, amount, depletion status, and shares burned

#### Yield Realization
- **More Than Deposited**: Users may receive more tokens than deposited due to accumulated yield/rebases
- **Proportional Share**: Withdrawal amount reflects user's proportional share of current vault assets
- **Automatic Compounding**: No manual action required to realize yield gains

#### Example Usage
```python
# User withdraws stETH after yield accumulation
withdrawal_amount, is_depleted = rebase_erc20_vault.withdrawTokensFromVault(
    user.address,
    steth_token.address,
    500_000000000000000,  # Request 0.5 stETH
    user.address,         # Recipient
    empty(addys.Addys),
    sender=teller.address
)

# User may receive more than 0.5 stETH if yield has accumulated
# withdrawal_amount could be 0.52 stETH if vault has gained 4% yield
```

6. **Return**: Returns transfer amount and from user depletion status

#### Events Emitted

- `RebaseErc20VaultTransfer` - Contains fromUser, toUser, asset, transferAmount, depletion status, and shares transferred

#### Liquidation Integration

#### Example Integration
```python
# Called by AuctionHouse during liquidation
transfer_amount, is_depleted = rebase_erc20_vault.transferBalanceWithinVault(
    steth_token.address,
    borrower.address,      # User being liquidated

## Yield Mechanics

### Share Price Calculation

The core of RebaseErc20's yield capture mechanism:

```python
# Share price calculation
totalAssetBalance = vault_contract.balance_of(asset)  # Includes accumulated yield
totalShares = vault_data.totalBalances[asset]         # Total shares outstanding

if totalShares > 0:
    sharePrice = totalAssetBalance / totalShares
else:
    sharePrice = 1.0  # Initial price for first deposit
```

### Yield Accumulation Process

1. **Initial State**: User deposits 100 tokens, receives 100 shares (1:1 ratio)
2. **Yield Accrual**: Token rebases to 105 balance in vault
3. **Share Price Increase**: Share price now 105/100 = 1.05 tokens per share
4. **User Benefit**: User's 100 shares worth 105 tokens (5% gain)
5. **New Deposits**: New depositor gets fewer shares per token due to higher share price

### Rebase Token Compatibility

RebaseErc20 vault works with various rebase mechanisms:

#### Positive Rebase (stETH, aTokens)
- Token balance increases automatically
- Share price increases proportionally
- All users benefit from yield automatically

#### Negative Rebase (rare)
- Token balance decreases
- Share price decreases proportionally
- Losses shared proportionally among users

#### Fixed Supply + External Rewards
- Token balance stays same
- External rewards added to vault
- Share price increases from reward accumulation

## Security Considerations

### Share-Based Protection
- **Donation Attack Prevention**: Decimal offset prevents share price manipulation
- **Proportional Fairness**: All users benefit from yield proportionally to their holdings
- **No Yield Theft**: Impossible for one user to claim another's accumulated yield

### Access Controls
- **Teller Only**: Deposits restricted to Teller contract
- **Authorized Withdrawals**: Withdrawals restricted to authorized protocol contracts
- **Liquidation Safety**: Share transfers maintain proportional ownership

### Yield Safety
- **Automatic Compounding**: No user action required to capture yield
- **No Timing Exploitation**: Share price reflects current state, preventing timing attacks
- **Fair Entry/Exit**: New and exiting users transact at current fair share price

### Integration Safety
- **Module Delegation**: Core logic handled by battle-tested SharesVault module
- **Event Consistency**: Contract-specific events provide clear audit trails
- **Collateral Accuracy**: CreditEngine receives accurate yield-inclusive valuations

## Usage Patterns

### Yield Farming
```python
# User deposits rebase token for automatic yield
teller.depositToVault(
    rebase_erc20_vault.address,
    steth_token.address,
    1_000000000000000000,  # 1 stETH
    sender=user.address
)

# Yield accumulates automatically over time
# User can check current value periodically
current_value = rebase_erc20_vault.getTotalAmountForUser(user.address, steth_token.address)
```

### Collateral with Yield
```python
# User's collateral value increases over time due to yield
# CreditEngine automatically considers current value including yield
credit_engine.borrow(
    user.address,
    green_token.address,
    1000_000000000000000000,  # Borrow GREEN
    sender=user.address
    # Collateral value includes accumulated stETH rewards
)
```

### Liquidation with Yield Transfer
```python
# During liquidation, accumulated yield transfers to liquidator
auction_house.liquidate(
    borrower.address,
    liquidator.address
    # Liquidator receives borrower's vault position including accumulated yield
)
```

## Differences from Other Vault Types

### vs. SimpleErc20 Vault
- **Share vs. Balance**: RebaseErc20 uses shares, SimpleErc20 uses direct balances
- **Yield Capture**: RebaseErc20 automatically captures yield, SimpleErc20 does not
- **Complexity**: RebaseErc20 requires share price calculations, SimpleErc20 is 1:1

### vs. StabilityPool Vault
- **Accounting Basis**: RebaseErc20 uses asset-based shares, StabilityPool uses USD-based shares
- **Yield Source**: RebaseErc20 from token rebases, StabilityPool from liquidation proceeds
- **Purpose**: RebaseErc20 for yield farming, StabilityPool for liquidation insurance

### vs. RipeGov Vault
- **Lock Mechanisms**: RebaseErc20 has no locking, RipeGov has time locks
- **Governance Features**: RebaseErc20 focuses on yield, RipeGov on governance participation
- **Reward Types**: RebaseErc20 captures asset yield, RipeGov earns governance points

## Best Practices

### For Users
- **Long-term Holding**: Yield compounds automatically, ideal for set-and-forget strategies
- **Monitor Share Price**: Track share price appreciation to understand yield generation
- **Consider Gas Costs**: Frequent deposits/withdrawals may erode yield gains

### For Integrators
- **Use Current Values**: Always query current asset values for accurate collateral assessment
- **Account for Yield**: Consider that user balances increase over time
- **Share-based Calculations**: When possible, work with shares rather than converting to assets
