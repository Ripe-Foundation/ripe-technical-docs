## Overview

Teller is the primary gateway to the Ripe Protocol, serving as a unified interface for all user operations. Like a comprehensive banking teller, it orchestrates complex multi-contract operations while providing user-friendly
interfaces and robust permission management.

**Unified Operations**:
- **Asset Management**: Deposits, withdrawals with automatic vault selection, configurable limits, and batch operations
- **Credit Services**: Borrowing against collateral and debt repayment with support for both Green and Savings Green tokens
- **Market Participation**: Liquidations, auction purchases, stability pool interactions, and collateral redemption
- **Rewards & Governance**: Loot claiming, Ripe bond purchases, and governance vault management
- **Delegation System**: Comprehensive permissions allowing authorized proxy operations with Underscore wallet integration

The contract abstracts protocol complexity through automatic vault selection, batch processing for gas efficiency, flexible payment handling, sophisticated permission hierarchies, and comprehensive event logging while maintaining security through thoughtful validation layers. It interfaces with [CreditEngine](CreditEngine.md) for borrowing operations, [VaultBook](../registries/VaultBook.md) for vault validation, and [Lootbox](Lootbox.md) for rewards coordination.

## Architecture & Modules

Teller is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

### Addys Module
- **Location**: `contracts/modules/Addys.vy`
- **Purpose**: Provides protocol-wide address resolution
- **Documentation**: See [Addys Technical Documentation](../shared-modules/Addys.md)
- **Key Features**:
  - Access to all protocol contract addresses
  - Validation of caller permissions
  - Centralized address management
- **Exported Interface**: Address utilities via `addys.__interface__`

### DeptBasics Module
- **Location**: `contracts/modules/DeptBasics.vy`
- **Purpose**: Provides department-level functionality
- **Documentation**: See [DeptBasics Technical Documentation](../shared-modules/DeptBasics.md)
- **Key Features**:
  - Pause mechanism for emergency stops
  - No minting capabilities (Teller is interface only)
- **Exported Interface**: Department basics via `deptBasics.__interface__`

### Module Initialization
```vyper
initializes: addys
initializes: deptBasics[addys := addys]
```

## Key Validation Logic

### Deposit Limits

The contract enforces multiple deposit limits:

1. **Per-User Limits**: Maximum deposit per user per asset
2. **Global Limits**: Protocol-wide deposit caps per asset
3. **Vault Limits**: Maximum assets per vault, maximum vaults per user
4. **Minimum Balance**: Ensures positions meet minimum thresholds

### Permission Hierarchy

Access control follows this hierarchy:

1. **Direct User**: Always has full permissions
2. **Ripe Departments**: Trusted protocol contracts bypass most limits
3. **Delegated Users**: Specific operation permissions
4. **Underscore Owners**: Smart wallet ownership verification
5. **General Permissions**: Configurable proxy permissions

### Automatic Vault Selection

When no vault is specified:

```
vaultId = getFirstVaultIdForAsset(asset)
vaultAddr = getAddr(vaultId)
```

This provides seamless UX by automatically routing to appropriate vaults.
